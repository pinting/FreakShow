WHO CAN IMPRESS THE FOREST?

These thoughts grow like warts on my soul
And I pick them like berries; I sort them out;
Injecting the spirit into pattern overhaul
Conserving the seed; harvesting the sprout;

Feeling the need; wishing for them to be aligned
within a canopy of disordered theory,
hoping that in the process I might find 
a true friend or at least effective therapy
