LOVE

I tried really hard last night
to dethrone you, to demystify the pain.

I tried to comprehend that you're biomatter
sculpted in this shape that I enjoy,
you're a subway network of nerves 
and arteries and veins.
You're warm tissue and grease.
Gases travel through you.
You snore.
You're just another sample of the great genome
in no way superior to the rest.

Yet, inside this meaty compound
there resides something unseen, a dark spell,
a malicious flame, your soul â€“
how can it control me?

I wondered, staring at your face:
if I broke your skull, could I get any closer
to the riddle? 
Could I then walk free?

Until I do,
I'm at the mercy of the elusive breath
that animates you and petfrifies me.
