# FreakShow

A video game experiment with photo based assets.

## Setup

The game was imagined based on a selection of music tracks - however, I do not own the rights to include them with the assets thus it is the duty of the end user to provide the necessary files to the engine.

* Clone the repository
* Place the proprietary music files into `Assets/Music`
* Open the project file with Godot 3.2.x
* Select `Project` -> `Export`
* Click on `Export All`
* The DMG and EXE application packs will be placed into the `out` folder

## Credits

* Denes Tornyi - programming, photo assets, character actor
* Godot Engine - engine, shaders, sprites of particles

## Music

The following tracks were used, but they are not commited to the repository because of copyright issues.

* `Cluster - Grosses Wasser` is used as music of Part01.
