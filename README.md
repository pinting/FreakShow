# FreakShow

A video game experiment with photo based assets.

## Setup

The game was imagined based on a selection of music tracks - however, I do not own the rights to include them with the assets thus it is the duty of the end user to provide the necessary files to the engine. They can be purchased for personal usage through popular 3rd party services.

* Clone the repository
* *(optional)* Place [the required proprietary music tracks](Assets/Music/README.md) into `Assets/Music`
* Open the project file with [Godot Editor](https://godotengine.org/) 3.2.x
* Select `Project` -> `Export`
* Click on `Export All`
* The DMG and EXE application files will be placed into the `out` directory

## Credits

* Denes Tornyi - programming, photo assets, character actor
* Godot Engine - engine, shaders, sprites of particles

## Music

The following tracks were used, but they are not commited to the repository.

* `Cluster - Grosses Wasser` is used as music of Part01.
