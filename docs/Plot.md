## Part00

### Room

The protagonist wakes up in the middle of the night. The location is an Eastern European block of flats. He stands next to an old rotten mattress - at the left side of the apartment. Two lights are hovering over the wretched room and lightning up the parquet which covers the whole floor. At the right side, an old fridge stands companied by an old table and a cupboard. Every surface is filled with empty bottles and trash. In the middle of the flat, a door is present, which leads into the hallway.

As the darkness fades away and the player gains control, the narrator says:

`It was already late into the night when something woke me up.`

### Hallway

After leaving the room by going out through the door, the protagonist finds himself standing in a hallway. It is a narrow passage with identical white doors and lights. The walls are covered with graffiti. It is infinite into both directions - after walking far into one direction, the player needs to turn around with the protagonist, in order to reach the end of it.

When the protagonist is walking for too long into a direction, the narrator speaks: 

`The hallway felt like an .`

After turning around, laughing can be heard and one of the closed doors opens up - and produces a sound to notify the player.

## Part01

### Until the ball

When the protagonist reaches the city, the narrator speaks:

`The city smelled like piss and sweat.`

When looking at the first paper which advertises goods, the narrator speaks again:

`People were ready to sell their junk. You just had to name your price.`

### Reaching the ball

A ball can be found along the way to the right side of the scene.

Sounds of a little girl wheeping can be heard.

After completing the ball game, the little girl stops wheeping and speaks: 

`Would you mind picking up the phone, mister? Maybe they are ringing for you.`
